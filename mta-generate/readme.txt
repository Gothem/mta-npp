The resource generates the mtalua-lang-import.xml file which is used to add color highlighting for MTA functions to Notepad++. It also generates a raw text file with all the MTA functions, which is later used to generate the other files.

Instructions:
1. Start the resource. (start mta-generate)
2. Join the server, and type generate then wait for the file to be generated.
3. You can then run the node app to generate the auto complete files. (contains functions arguments)
