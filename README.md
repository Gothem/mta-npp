MTA Notepad++ - Syntax Highlighting & Auto Completion
==============

mta-npp allows syntax highlighting and auto completion of MTA & Lua functions, with parameters.

N++ is highly customizable, you can add your own languages with syntax highlighting and auto completion. 

There are currently two files in the repo that are meant to the users:

- mtalua-lang-import.xml > The file to import in the user defined language page to get the syntax highlighting
- MTA-Lua.xml > The auto completion file

Steps
-----

1. Open Notepad++ > Language > Define your language...
2. Import > Select mtalua-lang-import.xml (Make sure from now on that the MTA-Lua language is always selected for Lua files)
3. Copy MTA-Lua.xml to your Notepad++ directory "Notepad++/plugins/APIs" (Usually in C:/Program Files)
